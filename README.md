# Pintos_alarm_clock

This is an assignment for NWEN302 based of the Stanford Pintos Alarm Clock assignment.

For this assignment, we were required to re implement the timer_sleep() function. The original function used the concept of busy waiting, and we were required to reimplement the function so that it no longer used busy waiting.
